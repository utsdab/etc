README for $RMANTREE/prman/etc/setup

This directory contains files used to perform a confidence test on the
installation of the PhotoRealistic RenderMan rendering system.  To perform
the confidence test, just type "make" in this directory.  If everything
is installed properly, "make" should run "prman" to create a new image
called "trial.tif " and then run "cmptiff" to compare the image to another
image "check.tif" which is shipped with the distribution.

If the comparison shows that the two images are very similar, the "cmptiff"
will print the message:

	"The images are essentially identical."

If something has gone wrong with installation, the images may be quite
different.  In this case, "cmptiff" will generate a message of the form:

	"The images are significantly different in %d pixels out of %d."

where the %d's are the numbers of pixels different and the total number
of pixels.  In this case, "cmptiff" will return an error code which will
abort the make.  There is something wrong, and you should check to
see that you have carried out the installation procedures correctly.

    # Crews are simply named lists of users:
    #
    #   "the_crew_name":  ["list", "of", "user", "names"],
    #
    # In addition to any site-defined crews, there are four "reserved"
    # crews names used for special purposes by Tractor:
    #   "ValidLogins",  "BannedLogins",  "Wranglers",  "Administrators"
    #
    # The ValidLogins crew enumerates all user's who are allowed to
    # login to Tractor.  This crew MUST exist.  See the note regarding
    # about the meta-names "@syslogins" and "@externlogins" below.
    #
    # The BannedLogins crew lists user names that are explicitly denied
    # login.  It is mostly only useful for providing exceptions when
    # ValidLogins contains either of the meta-names "@syslogins" or
    # "@externlogins".
    #
    #
    # Special Meta-Names: "@syslogins" and "@externlogins"
    #
    # The user name list for a given crew can include either of these
    # special names.  "@syslogins" stands for all user login names
    # that are valid locally on the engine host (i.e. resolvable by
    # the function getpwnam(3)), which frequently includes those
    # resolvable by the site nameservers, such as LDAP or NIS.
    # For example:
    #    "ValidLogins": ["@syslogins"],
    #
    # The name "@externlogins" causes the engine to skip its internal
    # validation of a potential Dashboard user names, and instead the
    # engine passes all login names directly to the site's external
    # trSiteLoginValidator.py script (or whichever validation app is
    # named as the "SitePasswordValidator" below). The external validator
    # can accept or deny a given name+password pair. For example:
    #    "ValidLogins": ["@externlogins"],
    #
    # Note that wildcard characters in user names (e.g. "*") are NOT
    # expanded or treated specially when searching for user access.
    # However, the list of user names can also contain OTHER CREW
    # names, which will be expanded recursively to include the users
    # in those crews.  Crew name references that form "reference loops"
    # will be truncated, but may cause unexpected memberships.
    #
    # Any user name in a crew's membership list whose first character
    # is a minus-sign will be removed from that crew definition,
    # similarly for sub-crew names.  For example:
    #  "ourRestrictedCrew": ["ourBigCrew", "-knownMiscreants"],
    #
    # Crews that are referenced in name lists can be denoted with
    # a leading "$" in order to make them clearly distinguished as
    # crew names rather than user names.  This approach also allows
    # tractor-engine to issue better diagnostic messages when a
    # referenced crew is unknown -- otherwise than name is just
    # treated as another user name.  For example:
    #   "theLuncheon": ["terry", "vandana", "$theGuysFromShipping"],
    #
    # A particular user name may appear in more than one crew.

    # Job Edit Permissions
    # --------------------
    # By default, everyone with a valid login is given "standard"
    # permissions, meaning the basic ability to run and modify their
    # own jobs and to view the state of the queue and the blades.
    # Users listed in the "Wranglers" crew are also allowed to alter
    # the general job queue, including the state of other user's jobs.
    # Users listed in the "Administrators" crew are allowed to change
    # site-wide policies through the URL interface.  The permission
    # levels are cumulative:  Wranglers have "standard" access plus the
    # additional wrangler permissions.  Administrators have standard,
    # wrangler, and admin access.
    #
    # The optional subdictionary "JobEditAccessPolicies" can be used
    # to further restrict or extend edit access to job attributes, such
    # as job priority.  A different access list can be specified for each
    # editable attribute, otherwise the settings for the entry named
    # "default" will apply. The special meta-crew name "@owner" in these
    # edit lists grants each job owner the permission edit the given
    # attribute in their own jobs.
    #
    # Edit permissions are organized into named "policies" with the one
    # named "defaultPolicy" applied by default.  Job scripts can specify
    # the policy that applies to them using the "Job -editpolicy {NAME}"
    # option.  Typically this is used by a studio's job creation pipeline
    # to apply additional restrictions on jobs from particular shows or
    # administrative jobs.  In cases where the job's specifically requested
    # policy is missing here, then the engine applies the settings from the
    # "defaultPolicy" entry, if it exists, rather than denying all edits
    # until the missing policy becomes defined.  Users in the Administrators
    # crew will always have edit control over any job.
    #
    # The recogonized fine-grained edit permission keywords include:
    #
    #   argv, afterjids, aftertime, bnotes, jnotes, comment, crews,
    #   cwd, delete, envkey, interrupt, jrestart, jshuffle, lock,
    #   metadata, maxactive, pause, priority, retract, retry,
    #   runsecsbounds, service, skip, slotbounds, tags, title
    #
    # In most cases the editable attributes are controlled by a key name
    # below that is the same as the attribute name, as listed by the command:
    # "tq attributes job"
    #

    # SitePasswordValidator
    # ---------------------
    # "SitePasswordValidator" specifies a validation scheme for passwords
    # sent to the engine from user interfaces and scripts.  Use an empty
    # string "" to disable password checking, allowing any valid user
    # name to proceed as a client (the names authorized in ValidLogins).
    #
    # Any non-empty value for "SitePasswordValidator" will cause
    # passwords to be required, and specifies the type of validation
    # that will be applied.  All user+password validation occurs on
    # the tractor-engine host, so values here are relative to the
    # engine's environment, filesystem, operating system, etc.
    #
    # Tractor engine has built-in support for the "PAM" authentication
    # system provided by Linux and Mac OS.  Only the engine needs this
    # support, clients can be on any platform.  Use the string value
    # "internal:PAM" below to enable password validation through the
    # PAM modules on your engine host.
    #
    # The PAM scheme itself requires you to choose an appropriate access
    # policy module (see /etc/pam.d or /etc/pam.conf).  Tractor will
    # attempt to load a module named "tractor" by default, and you must
    # define that module first, using appropriate policies for your site.
    # Alternatively, you can specify a different PAM module name here,
    # one that may already exist and support your site's requirements.
    # For example to get the "su" authentication rules, use "internal:PAM:su"
    # below.
    #
    # Tractor-engine sends a session cookie to the dashboard web browser
    # after you authenticate with a password. The saved session information
    # can be used later for automatic login when a fresh dashboard page is
    # reloaded. This auto-login behavior can be disabled, forcing users to
    # reenter their passwords when the dashboard page is reloaded, by
    # changing the prefix in the SitePasswordValidator setting; change
    # "internal:" to "internal_nocookie:", or add the prefix
    # "external_nocookie:" for external validation scripts.
    #
    # **NOTE** The PAM approach requires tractor-engine to present a
    # clear-text password to the PAM interface, thus it must receive a
    # recoverable password encoding from the Dashboard and client scripts.
    # The built-in transfer encoding provides modest protection from
    # snooping, but your principal password transport protection is
    # expected to come from the security of your site's private LAN and
    # VPN connections into it.
    #
    # Tractor also supports a more involved custom alternative solution
    # in which you provide your own client-side one way password hashing
    # plug-in (javascript or python, as appropriate), and a matching
    # engine-side hash validator that you name here.  See the comments
    # in the template examples, and the Tractor administrative docs for
    # more details.
